# Agent Assignment Protocol

## 🤖 For Coding Agents

**⚠️ MANDATORY ONBOARDING REQUIRED ⚠️**

Before working on any issue or task in this repository, ALL coding agents must:

1. **Complete Onboarding**: Read `.github/agents/ONBOARDING.md` thoroughly
2. **Review Instructions**: Read `.github/agents/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
3. **Study Technical Docs**: Review the main `README.md`
4. **Complete Checklist**: Ensure all onboarding checklist items are done

## 📚 Required Reading (in order)

1. **`.github/agents/ONBOARDING.md`** - Ecosystem overview, OINIO philosophy, development workflow
2. **`.github/agents/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** - Task execution guidelines and quick reference
3. **`README.md`** - Technical architecture and API documentation

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Quantum Pi Forge is a comprehensive ecosystem with:
- 6 interconnected services
- Philosophical framework (OINIO)
- Specific design patterns (Sacred Trinity Architecture)
- Real-time integrations with production services

Understanding this context ensures:
- High-quality contributions
- Consistency across the ecosystem
- No breaking changes to live services
- Alignment with project philosophy

## ✅ Verification

After reading the onboarding materials, you should be able to answer:

- What is the OINIO philosophy?
- What are the 6 services in the Quantum Pi Forge ecosystem?
- What is the Sacred Trinity Architecture?
- How do you test changes locally?
- Where is the API gateway and why use it?
- What is the primary color scheme?

If you can't answer these, go back and read the onboarding!

## 🚀 Once Onboarding is Complete

You are now ready to:
- Work on assigned issues
- Make meaningful contributions
- Understand the broader context of your changes
- Follow established patterns and conventions
