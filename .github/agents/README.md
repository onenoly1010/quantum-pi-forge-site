- Emergency contacts

**Time to Complete**: 5-10 minutes
**Importance**: Critical - ensures proper workflow

## 🎯 Purpose

These documents ensure that all coding agents have the necessary context about:

- **Ecosystem Architecture**: Understanding how this site integrates with 6 live services
- **Philosophy**: OINIO principles and Sacred Trinity Architecture
- **Standards**: Code style, design patterns, and best practices
- **Workflow**: Proper development, testing, and deployment procedures
- **Integration**: How to work with the API gateway and live services

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### For All Agents

**DO NOT** start working on any issue or task until you have:
1. ✅ Read ONBOARDING.md completely
2. ✅ Read AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md completely
3. ✅ Reviewed the main README.md
4. ✅ Completed the onboarding checklist
5. ✅ Set up local development environment
6. ✅ Tested the site locally

### Why This Matters

Quantum Pi Forge is not just another web project. It's part of a larger ecosystem with:

- **Live Production Services**: Changes affect real users and systems
- **Complex Integrations**: 6 services communicate through this site
- **Philosophical Foundation**: Code reflects OINIO principles
- **Specific Patterns**: Sacred Trinity Architecture guides design decisions

Skipping onboarding leads to:
- ❌ Misaligned changes that don't fit the ecosystem
- ❌ Breaking integrations with production services
- ❌ Inconsistent code and design patterns
- ❌ Rework and wasted effort

Taking time to onboard properly results in:
- ✅ High-quality, contextually appropriate contributions
- ✅ Faster task completion (you understand what to do)
- ✅ Fewer bugs and issues
- ✅ Better collaboration and code consistency

## 📖 Additional Resources

After completing onboarding, also review:

- **Main README.md**: Technical architecture and API documentation (in repository root)
- **Live Site**: https://onenoly1010.github.io/quantum-pi-forge-site/
- **Live Dashboard**: https://onenoly1010.github.io/quantum-pi-forge-site/dashboard.html
- **Related Repositories**: Links provided in onboarding document

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you have questions after completing onboarding:

1. Check the documentation again - answer might be there
2. Review existing code for patterns and examples
3. Create an issue in the repository with specific questions
4. Tag relevant maintainers for guidance

## ✅ Onboarding Verification

After reading all materials, you should be able to answer:

1. What is the OINIO philosophy?
2. What are the 6 services in the Quantum Pi Forge ecosystem?
3. What is the Sacred Trinity Architecture (Guardian, Executor, Observer)?
4. How do you run the site locally?
5. What is the purpose of api/ecosystem-gateway.js?
6. What is the primary color scheme?
7. What are the three status types for services?
8. How often does the dashboard update metrics?
9. What is glass-morphism design?
10. What testing should you do before committing?

If you can't answer these questions, review the onboarding materials again.

## 🚀 Ready to Contribute

Once you've completed onboarding, you're ready to:

- Take on assigned issues
- Make meaningful contributions
- Maintain ecosystem consistency
- Follow established patterns
- Produce high-quality code
